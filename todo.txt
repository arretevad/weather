P0:
* Auto generate the snow map based on coordinates
* Better sorting of data...
  * Does it make sense to make a CSV per datatype? Maybe PM will have an opinion
* Make stations an object? (Will be more important when dealing with additional sources)
  * Two things: 1) *generate* from file and 2) *load* from file


Pother
* Support for trips longer than a week or so (polling API for longer may not work)
* Add support for mesowest?
* Print errors (like when can't find weather folder)

Arrange data by: 
 * Wks (datatype)
   * T1: All Data
   * T2: Rows: Days of Trip, Cols: One for all stations, One for each station

DONE:
X More efficient API usage, e.g. poll for all stations at once
X Pass in only TMIN and TMAX to avoid filtering...
X Put on github for my own sake
X Make command line driven, e.g. support args
X Fix the loop in get station data, should take date range not generate it...
