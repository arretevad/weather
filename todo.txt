P0:
* Pass in only TMIN and TMAX to avoid filtering...
* Auto generate the snow map based on coordinates
* Better sorting of data... 


Pother
* Support for trips longer than a week or so (polling API for longer may not work)
* Add support for mesowest?
* Make command line driven, e.g. support args
* Print errors (like when can't find weather folder)
* Put on github for my own sake
* Fix the loop in get station data, should take date range not generate it...

DONE:
X More efficient API usage, e.g. poll for all stations at once
